        <div class="center-cont">
            <p>In my work at Microsoft I work with State agencies on ideating, designing, and prototyping solutions to meet business needs. I'm sharing some of these prototype solutions below in the spirit of thought sharing.</p>

            <p class="proj-desc">New Mexico's Environment Department receives requests for document signature via email. Previously, they had a staff member who would manually print these off and coordinate collecting signatures of four people at the agency. I designed and built a <b>correspondence management</b> prototype for the agency to alleviate their staff from this manual task.</p>
            <p class="proj-desc">The prototype automatically handles the reception of documents, task routing, signature collections, and then delivery back to the original requestor via email. This minimizes the human interaction to only the areas in which it matters: reviewing and signing the documents.</p>
