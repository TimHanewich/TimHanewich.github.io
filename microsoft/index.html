        <!--Description-->
        <div class="center-cont">
            <p>In my role at Microsoft I work with State agencies on ideating, designing, and prototyping solutions to meet business needs. I'm sharing some of these prototype solutions below in the spirit of thought sharing.</p>

        <!--Correspondence Management-->
        <div class="center-cont" style="margin-top: 50px;">
            <h2 class="sol-title">Correspondence Management</h2>
            <h3 class="sol-customer">New Mexico Environment Department</h3>
            <p class="proj-desc">New Mexico's Environment Department receives requests for document signature via email. Previously, they had a staff member who would manually print these off and coordinate collecting signatures of four people at the agency. I designed and built a <b>correspondence management</b> prototype for the agency to alleviate their staff from this manual task.</p>
            <p class="proj-desc">The prototype automatically handles the reception of documents, task routing, signature collections, and then delivery back to the original requestor via email. This minimizes the human interaction to only the areas in which it matters: reviewing and signing the documents.</p>

            <h2 class="sol-title">Offender Mail Processing</h2>
            <h3 class="sol-customer">Kansas Department of Corrections</h3>
            <p class="proj-desc">Kansas is looking to combat the spread of drugs and contraband through the offender mail system. Violating substances often enter the facility through the mail system. Kansas identified digitizing the mail system as an opportunity to solve this issue.</p>
            <p class="proj-desc">I worked with Kansas' Department of Corrections on ideating and designing what a solution that would address these needs would look like on Microsoft's <b>Power Platform</b>. I designed a proof-of-concept of this system.</p>
            <p class="proj-desc">A staff member at the Dept. of Corrections scans incoming offender mail with a mobile application. The contents (written word) are analyzed with optical character recognition and cognitive services and are assessed on five risk profiles: gang, weapon, drug, violence, and conduct. If any risk rating surpasses a specific threshold, facility administrators are alerted of this. Offenders later review the letters over a touch screen tablet.</p>

            <h3 class="sol-customer">Kansas Department of Corrections</h3>
            <p class="proj-desc">Kansas' Department of Corrections was searching for a modern system to migrate their offender booking workflow to. I designed and built an offender booking system on the Power Platform for Kansas.</p>
            <p class="proj-desc">The system handles the entire booking process including mugshot capture, body marking/imager capture, demographics data input, badge generation, and infractiong logging.</p>
